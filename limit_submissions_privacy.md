# What information do we collect?

The add-on is able to access your email and can read and write to all your forms.

# How do you use the information?

- You email is used for the authentication purposes only. We never record it, we never share it with anyone else, we never send you any emails.
- An access to your forms is needed for the add-on to do its job. When you enable the add-on it adds an event listener to the form you enabled it for. It listens to the submit events and updates a banner with the information about the number of submissions. Optionally you can make it automatically close the form when the total number of submissions you've specified is reached.

# What information do you share?
